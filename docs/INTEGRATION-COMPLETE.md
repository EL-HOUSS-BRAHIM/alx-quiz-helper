# âœ… ALX Payment Bypass Integration Complete

## Overview
Successfully integrated the ALX Payment Wall Bypass functionality into the Quiz Helper Extension. The extension now provides value even when not used for quizzes by automatically removing payment walls across all ALX platform pages.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Payment Bypass Content Script
**File:** `/content-scripts/payment-bypass.js`
- Automatically detects and removes payment walls
- Uses MutationObserver to catch dynamically added payment dialogs
- Tracks bypass count across page session
- Handles both automatic and manual bypass triggers

### 2. Updated Manifest Configuration
**File:** `manifest.json`
- Added `*://*.alxafrica.com/*` to `host_permissions`
- Added bypass script to content_scripts for:
  - Savanna platform: `*://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/*`
  - All ALX sites: `*://*.alxafrica.com/*`

### 3. Enhanced Popup UI
**File:** `popup/popup.html`
- Added new "Payment Bypass" card with blue gradient design
- Shows bypass status (Active/Inactive)
- Displays total bypassed count
- Manual "Trigger Bypass" button for on-demand activation

### 4. Updated Popup Logic
**File:** `popup/popup.js`
- Added `triggerBypassBtn` and `bypassCount` element references
- Created `updateBypassStatus()` function to query bypass count from content script
- Created `handleBypassClick()` function for manual bypass trigger
- Status updates automatically on popup open

## How It Works

### Automatic Mode
1. User navigates to any ALX page
2. Bypass script loads automatically
3. Removes payment walls immediately and continuously monitors for new ones
4. Runs checks at 500ms, 1s, 2s, and 3s intervals
5. MutationObserver watches for dynamically added payment elements

### Manual Mode
1. User opens extension popup
2. Clicks "Trigger Bypass" button
3. Script performs immediate bypass check
4. Updates UI with results (e.g., "Removed 3 payment elements")
5. Bypass count increments

## Features

### What Gets Removed
- Payment dialog elements
- SDK blocking overlays (`.sdk` class)
- High z-index payment modals
- Fixed/absolute positioned payment walls
- Elements with "Payment required", "Make a payment", etc.

### What Gets Restored
- Pointer events on interactive elements
- Page scrolling (removes `overflow: hidden`)
- Body and root element interactivity
- Full page accessibility

## Testing Instructions

1. **Load Extension**
   ```
   1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
   2. Enable "Developer mode"
   3. Click "Load unpacked"
   4. Select the quiz-helper-extension folder
   ```

2. **Test Automatic Bypass**
   ```
   1. Navigate to any ALX page with payment wall
   2. Payment wall should disappear automatically
   3. Check console for: "ðŸ”“ Bypass: Removed X payment elements"
   ```

3. **Test Manual Bypass**
   ```
   1. Open extension popup
   2. Check "Payment Bypass" card shows "Active"
   3. Click "Trigger Bypass" button
   4. Should see success message with count
   ```

4. **Test Status Tracking**
   ```
   1. Open popup after bypassing some walls
   2. Bypass count should show accumulated total
   3. Number should persist during page session
   ```

## File Structure

## Key Functions

âœ… Visual feedback on bypass activity

### Technical
âœ… Clean integration with existing codebase

âœ… Proper error handling and fallbacks

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Persistent Stats**
   - Store bypass count in chrome.storage
   - Show lifetime statistics in popup

2. **Settings Toggle**
   - Add enable/disable option for bypass
   - Allow users to control auto-bypass behavior

3. **Visual Indicator**

4. **Advanced Detection**
   - Machine learning for payment wall patterns
   - Configurable bypass rules

## Troubleshooting

### Bypass Not Working
- Refresh the ALX page
- Check if extension has permissions for the site
- Look for console errors in Developer Tools
- Try manual trigger from popup

### Count Not Updating
- Close and reopen popup
- Count resets on page reload (by design)
- Check if you're on an ALX domain

### No Popup Button
